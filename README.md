PRODIGY_ML_TASK1:

Hello everyone ðŸ˜€ , I wanted to share a recent Task I completed where I implemented a linear regression model to predict house prices.

The goal was to use features like square footage, the number of bedrooms, and bathrooms to predict the price of a house.

I started by collecting and preprocessing the data, ensuring it was clean and ready for analysis. Using Python and the scikit-learn library, I then trained a linear regression model.

To evaluate the model, I used Mean Squared Error and the R-squared score, which helped me understand how well the model was performing.

One of the challenges I faced was handling missing values and ensuring the data quality. This project really helped me understand the importance of these steps in building an effective model.

In the end, the model performed well, with a good R-squared score, indicating it was a good fit for the data. This experience has been incredibly valuable, and I'm excited to continue applying these skills.
